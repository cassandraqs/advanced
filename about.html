						<h2>ABOUT ADVANCE</h2>
						<hr>

					<div class="intro-advance">
						<p>
							ADVANCE - The Association for the Development of Vocal Artistry and Neighborhood Cultural Enrichment, is a community-based, non-profit vocal arts organization, setting new standards in musical programming and arts education in New York City. <a href="http://moreopera.com/" target="blank">MORE Opera</a> is a division of ADVANCE which focus on performing and bringing opera to public.
						</p>
						<p>
							ADVANCE has trained community residents to participate in its professional level musical performances since 1989. In 2002 ADVANCE’s opera producing arm, MORE Opera began preparing a community chorus to perform in concert with professional opera artists, trained by recognized arts educators and experts in opera and performance.</p>

							<p><strong>The training program</strong> allows participants to explore the transformative world of opera through professional level experiences in rehearsal and performance, to develop musicianship, learn about vocal technique, repertoire, and style, and performance practices. The chorus rehearses one or two times per week for six weeks prior to a performance. The singers practice in a calm and engaging rehearsal environment, and extra rehearsal time and sectionals are provided to non-readers and others who may need additional preparation. All participants are fully and sufficiently rehearsed and prepared for performance. Rehearsals are conducted by Metropolitan Opera Baritone Richard Hobson and musical director Ming Kwong. Cheryl Warfield gives sectionals and individual coaching to participants who are new to opera.</p>

							<p>Participation is open to all, with or without previous opera or choral experience who love to sing, have an interest in or curiosity about opera and desire to work together to achieve excellence in performing grand opera. The chorus is comprised of approximately 50 singers from diverse backgrounds, including music students, emerging artists, theatre performers, and community members of different ages, ethnic and racial backgrounds and disciplines. New participants are accepted with each opera project via an audition that consists of the singer’s choice of song in any style or language, vocalization to determine voice type/placement and a short conversation about background and interest in opera. Participants audition only once for the chorus, but may be asked to audition again for consideration for small roles or special ensembles.</p>

							<p>Among the chorus activities for 2013-14 are outreach performances of Verdi’s AIDA, participation in vocal master classes conducted by Richard Hobson and Maestro Anton Coppola, and a gala concert performance of Puccini’s Tosca with orchestra that also includes a children’s chorus which will receive the same training.</p>
							<p><strong>ADVANCE: Bridging Communities through Opera’s Origins and Ethnicities is made possible in part with public funds from the Manhattan Community Arts Fund, supported by the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council and administered by Lower Manhattan Cultural Council.</strong></p>
